# Online-Communication-and-Vulnerability-Check
Information Security is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. 

This part of prevention involves the detection of system vulnerabilities to ensure they are protected against any form of attack from the outside. This project deals with the case of system vulnerabilities and applies various tools such as Metasploit and Veil and uses the inbuilt data set to predict and classify system vulnerability detection into categories such as Low, Medium, High. The project runs the dataset on seven different algorithms and compares the efficiency and parameters- f1 score, precision and model accuracy. Based on the results obtained, we make a comparative analysis between the algorithms applied and reach a conclusion.
